# Digital Agent of Sebastian Friedrich Nestler

## Overview
This repository contains a simple, static web page that integrates a digital AI agent. The purpose is to provide an interactive, conversational interface for visitors, enhancing the user experience on the site.

The agent is powered by an external service (D-ID in this case) and is embedded directly into the HTML using a single JavaScript <script> tag. The agent was trained using the results of a personal personality test to accurately reflect my persona, along with extensive documentation on IT security, networking, and privacy to give it domain-specific knowledge.

## Features
Interactive AI Agent: A lifelike, conversational agent that can answer questions and engage with users.

**Client-Side Integration:** The agent is fully integrated on the front-end, with no server-side components required for the agent's functionality.

**Easy to Host:** The entire project consists of a single HTML file, making it perfect for static site hosting services like GitHub Pages.
